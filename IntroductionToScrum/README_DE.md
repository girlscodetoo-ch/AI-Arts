# AI-Arts - Technik Tage 2022 - Part 3 - Scrum and Design Thinking
![](../images/GCT_Logo.png)

**Context**: Now that thy when through all the trouble to train and build and app … how can they make sure that people are using the app?  
 

# Part 1 - ALL TOGETHER 

- They reflect on what makes an app an app of the daily life / habit for them? Which app are they using daily, weekly, …. How many app did they only downloaded and never used?  
- General good practice to make apps sticky? E.g., gamification  
- User journey analysis: What make you use the app and download in the first place  
  - User persona 1: Person interested in Art 
  - User persona 2: Person that like to do fun things with the family 
  - UP3: etc.  

- Define key features and define them in priority in time --> in summary they are designing sprint 1  

- Front end features brainstorming

- Backend features brainstorming

--> here everyone should be able to say something as there is nothing right or wrong  

**Note**: Features will be written on Post and posted on the board --> then in a second step, the postits will be sorted in priority for the 1st sprint. The sorting will be done in the classic buckets (backlog, current sprint, …)  

# Part 2 - SPLIT in X (at least 3) different groups  

CONTEXT: The first sprint is over, and the groups get X different feedbacks to which they need to adapt  

- SCENARIO 1: Few downloads and teams members say they found out that the app is difficult to find in the App Store. What can you do to solve that situation?  

- SCENARIO 2 Priorities have changed in the management. How can you adapt and allocate the resource to satisfy management and continue the POC, Proof-of-Concept, on your app since you believe in it  

- SCENARIO 3: Too many downloads and not expected, servers are crashing. What can they do in Sprint 2 to address these unforeseen issues?  

number of downloads is high (metric 1 is good) but the daily use is low (second metric is bad) --> The student need to figure out what is the problem and ask the right questions. Then the instructor give them the next hint where they see that the server s are crashing quite often 

# Part 3 -  Reflection on the scrum process

The teams should realise that they were able to adapt in a fast and structured way to the things happening with the project. Explain the different scrum concepts and how quite instinctively they applied the scrum concepts without knowing it. 

Understand why scrum is organised in sprints (answer: you cannot plan on a long term for software projects with several stakeholders as the requirement change over time and you need to solve the issues from the past as well. Stakeholders are the people who have certain business requirements for the project.)
